##### Use case
Say you are tasked with changing the names of many PDF files by replacing a porition of the filename with a new name.

For example:

Current pdf name: TEST-INC_2020_02
Target pdf name:  DAVE-INC_2020_02

This script is able to change the "TEST-INC" porition of the name with "DAVE-INC" while keeping "2020_02" porition.
